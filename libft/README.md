**Project summary** 
Recreation of basic C functions and adding them to libft library. For more info check _libft.pdf_

**Testing**
The project was tested by myself, peers and three testers ([libft-war-machine](https://github.com/y3ll0w42/libft-war-machine), [libft-unit-tests](https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test) and [libft-Tripouille](https://github.com/Tripouille/libftTester))

**Attempts**
1st try: 0% (memory leaks in ft_split)
2nd try: 97% overal/125% Moulinette (ft_atoi didn't address extreme cases, insufficient protection in some bonus functions)
3rd try: 125%

**libft_main** - libft with main functions inside
**libft_norminette** - submitted folder
