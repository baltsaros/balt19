First meeting in the Catacombs
Good day! You look reasonably sane!
What are you doing in the Catacombs?
Are you a Cleric or something?
answer No
No? Well, that's strange.
Ohhh, I know what it is. You've come for the trinkets, haven't you?
Well whatever it is…
This place is treacherous. Do watch your step.
Heh heh heh…
answer Yes
Yes, I imagined as much.
Best of luck with your pilgrimages or missions or whatever you do.
This place is treacherous. Do watch your step, eh?
Heh heh heh…
activating the bridge trap after meeting him
Ah, oh! Well, how are you, then?
…I slipped and flipped that lever, you see…
…It didn't cause you any trouble, by chance?
answer No
Oh, really? Yes, I see…Righty-oh!
Then everything's good, isn't it?
I'm Trusty Patches, the one and only!
You and I, just a couple of undead outcasts, right mate? / You and I, just a couple of undead outcasts, right, my darling?
Heh heh heh…
answer Yes
Are you certain?!
Well that's a fine shame. Oh, I'm truly sorry, really!
But, wait now, you didn't actually fall down, then?
Well, why didn't you tell me sooner! All's well that ends well!
Everybody makes mistakes. I'm not above it all, I swear!
I'm trusty Patches, the one-and-only!
I know! This should make up for it. (gives Humanity x1)
We're on the same side! Undead outcasts!
Fantastic isn't it?
Heh heh heh…
activating the bridge trap before meeting him
Ah, oh! Well, well, how are you, then?
I, uh, sort of lost my way, yes…
But when I came here, I didn't touch any levers, no, not me!
Very peculiar, isn't it? Wait, did something happen to you?
Hey, don't look at me like that. I'm Trusty Patches, the one-and-only!
Here, everything's good with us, eh? Aww, c'mon, take it! (gives Soul of a Lost Undead x1)
Heh heh. We'll be wonderful friends.
Heh heh heh…
Oh, does it really matter that much?
C'mon now. What exactly do you think I did?
You're not making sense, my friend.
Heh heh heh…
next meeting in the Tomb of the Giants after meeting in the Catacombs
What you again? Well, well!
You've been a stranger. Ah, good to see you're well, mate.
Oh right, you came at the perfect time.
There's a fine stash of treasure right down that hole.
I found it first, but…well, we're friends now. I'll split it with you!
In any case, have a look, it'll shimmer you blind!
Heh heh heh…
if you talk again, before he kicks you off the ledge
There, that hole. Take a closer look.
after he kicks you off the ledge
Heh heh, this is what I do, my friend.
The trinkets I'll be stripping off your corpse; that's the real treasure!
Nyah hah hah hah!
next time you meet
…Oh, you, I…
Let's just calm down. Talk about things…
I did you wrong. But, I didn't mean it.
These temptations, they can, well, overcome me…
You know what I mean? Don't you? Please forgive me.
You and me, we're jolly Undead outcasts, aren't we?
answer No
Oh for heaven's sake, let's not mope about, eh?
You're still alive, I've said I'm sorry!
Wait, I know! Here, take this. It proves something, doesn't it?
Gives Twin Humanities
Heh heh heh…
answer Yes
Oh, brilliant. A second chance! Wonderful!
I had a feeling you'd understand. I did.
But if I were in your shoes…Ooh! Who knows what I'd have done?
But now we're friends again, eh?
Heh heh heh…
next time you talk
I did you wrong. But I didn't mean it.
These temptations, they can, well, overcome me…
You know what I mean? Don't you? Please forgive me.
