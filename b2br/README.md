## **Project summary** 
> You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you canâ€™t use VirtualBox) under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up your own operating system while implementing strict rules.

For bonus part it is required to set up a more complex partition, a functional WordPress website and an extra service of my choice.

I worked with Debian OS, as a service of my choice I used vsftp (but could not fully configurate it) and Fail2Ban. To my mind, the project is pretty straightforward. All you need is to read a lot of manuals, google and test. 

## **Testing**
The project was tested by myself and peers

## **Attempts**
**_1st try_**: 125%

## **Tips**
* RTFM
* Ask peers
* Google - your main friend for this project
* Keep going
* Don't forget to apply password date policy to root and your main user (man chage)
* If you do any math operations, pay attention to the types of variables (if you add/substract float from int, you will get int result)
